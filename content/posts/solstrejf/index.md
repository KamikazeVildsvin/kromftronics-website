Solstrejf, roughly translated from Danish to "sun streak" or "sun touch", is a four-voice analog sine wave drone oscillator. 

I was on a hike in Sweden out near a beautiful forest lake just around the break of dawn. 
The way the sun interacted with nature gave me a real sense of calm and ease. 
At that moment I thought, what if I could create an instrument that would be able to replicate this feeling? 
A sine wave drone synthesizer came to my mind, similar to the early Musique Concr√®te test equipment techniques.

## Introduction
I wanted the instrument to be playful and interactive. 
Four sine wave oscillators in itself are maybe not that interesting and can become static. 
A modulation matrix, which would allow for all four voices to modulate parameters like frequency and amplitude on all other voices would create more complex soundscapes.

The basic idea and block diagram can be seen above in figure 1, where four identical voice boards are connected to the mod-matrix board and a power supply/mixer board for output summation.

## Schematic, PCB, & Simulation Files
All of simulation files, schematics, and PCB files can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/KamikazeVildsvin/Solstrejf).
All of the files that you need in order to produce PCB's for this design can be found there.
