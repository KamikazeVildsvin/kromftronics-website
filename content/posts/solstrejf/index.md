Can you imaging what four sinewave oscillators would sound like, if they cross modulate the amplitude, pitch, and pan of each other?
I couldn't, until I finished my latest DIY synthesizer project --- ðŸŒž **Solstrejf** ðŸŒž.

Solstrejf, which roughly translates from Danish to "sun streak" or "sun touch", is a four-voice analog sinewave drone oscillator that I designed and build from scratch.
I was on a hike in Sweden, out near a beautiful forest lake just around the break of dawn. 
The way the sun interacted with nature gave me a real sense of calm and ease. 
In that moment, I thought, "what if I could create an instrument that would be able to replicate this feeling"? 
A sine wave drone synthesizer came to my mind, similar to the early Musique ConcrÃ¨te test equipment techniques.

In this article, I'll be describing the ideas behind the design, and the different building blocks that makes up Solstrejf.
As always, all of the design files are available (see [this]({{< relref "#schematic-pcb--simulation-files" >}}) section below)

## Introduction

I wanted the instrument to be playful and interactive. 
Four sine wave oscillators in itself are maybe not that interesting and can become static. 
A modulation matrix, which would allow for all four voices to modulate parameters like frequency and amplitude on all other voices would create more complex soundscapes.

The basic idea and block diagram can be seen above in figure 1, where four identical voice boards are connected to the mod-matrix board and a power supply/mixer board for output summation.

## Schematic, PCB, & Simulation Files
All of simulation files, schematics, and PCB files can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/KamikazeVildsvin/Solstrejf).
All of the files that you need in order to produce PCB's for this design can be found there.

Basically, the I decided to split the design four different PCBs:

- Voice board PCB:
    - One sinewave oscillator.
    - Three CV mixers (amp, frequency, pan).
    - An envelope generator chip.

- Voice control PCB:
    - Potentiometers controlling parameters for a single voice board.

- PSU/Mixer PCB:
    - Stereo master mixer for all four voices
    - Linear +/-15V AC/DC PSU

- Modulation matrix PCB:
    - df
