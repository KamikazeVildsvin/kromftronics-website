Hello! And thank you for stopping by ٩(^ᴗ^)۶. Kromftronics is an alias and website for collecting and sharing all of my electronic sound projects.

The projects are more “analog” in nature at the moment, but I also plan to share some software related audio DSP stuff in the future. I try to share as much of the design as possible, including PCB’s, schematics, code, simulation files, etc. Hopefully, this will be useful for someone out there trying to create their own sound machines.
